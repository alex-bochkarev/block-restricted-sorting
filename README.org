#+TITLE: "Block-Restricted Sorting" repo.

* General info

The code in =brs.py= reads the instance (in =blocks= format specified below) and
makes a plot depicting the relative "position" of the blocks. The latter
can be compiled to PDF (requires [[www.graphviz.org][graphviz]])

Specific commands are in =Makefile=.

In the figure, an arrow points from node =bi= to node =bj= iff the number of
inversions in (=bi=, =bj=) is no more than that in (=bj=, =bi=). Informally,
an arc reads "no more than." 

* Instance file format
Each line encodes a single block of numbers, separated by commas. For example,
=cyc3.blocks= of the following contents:

#+begin_source
4
1,5,6
2,3,7
#+end_source

encodes an instance of =[4] [1,5,6] [2,3,7]= (i.e., with three blocks).
